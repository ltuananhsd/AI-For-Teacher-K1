When you’re ready to deploy your LangChain agent to production, LangSmith provides a managed hosting platform designed for agent workloads. Traditional hosting platforms are built for stateless, short-lived web applications, while LangGraph is **purpose-built for stateful, long-running agents** that require persistent state and background execution. LangSmith handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns so you can deploy directly from your repository.

##

[​](#prerequisites)

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

 * A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
 * A [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) (free to sign up)

Deploy your agent

###

[​](#1-create-a-repository-on-github)

1\. Create a repository on GitHub

Your application’s code must reside in a GitHub repository to be deployed on LangSmith. Both public and private repositories are supported. For this quickstart, first make sure your app is LangGraph-compatible by following the [local server setup guide](/oss/python/langchain/studio#setup-local-agent-server). Then, push your code to the repository.

2

[](#)

Create new deployment

Click the **\+ New Deployment** button. A pane will open where you can fill in the required fields.

3

Deploy repository

Select your application’s repository. Click **Submit** to deploy. This may take about 15 minutes to complete. You can check the status in the **Deployment details** view.

###

[​](#3-test-your-application-in-studio)

3\. Test your application in Studio

Once your application is deployed:

 1. Select the deployment you just created to view more details.
 2. Click the **Studio** button in the top right corner. Studio will open to display your graph.

###

[​](#4-get-the-api-url-for-your-deployment)

4\. Get the API URL for your deployment

 1. In the **Deployment details** view in LangGraph, click the **API URL** to copy it to your clipboard.
 2. Click the `URL` to copy it to the clipboard.

###

[​](#5-test-the-api)

5\. Test the API

You can now test the API:

 * Python

 * Rest API

 1. Install LangGraph Python:

Copy

 pip install langgraph-sdk

 2. Send a message to the agent:

Copy

 from langgraph_sdk import get_sync_client # or get_client for async

 client = get_sync_client(url="your-deployment-url", api_key="your-langsmith-api-key")

 for chunk in client.runs.stream(
 None, # Threadless run
 "agent", # Name of agent. Defined in langgraph.json.
 input={
 "messages": [{
 "role": "human",
 "content": "What is LangGraph?",
 }],
 },
 stream_mode="updates",
 ):
 print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
 print(chunk.data)
 print("\n\n")

Copy

 curl -s --request POST \
 --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/runs/stream \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --header "X-Api-Key: <LANGSMITH API KEY> \
 --data "{
 \"assistant_id\": \"agent\", `# Name of agent. Defined in langgraph.json.`
 \"input\": {
 \"messages\": [
 {
 \"role\": \"human\",
 \"content\": \"What is LangGraph?\"
 }
 ]
 },
 \"stream_mode\": \"updates\"
 }"

LangSmith offers additional hosting options, including self-hosted and hybrid. For more information, please see the [Platform setup overview](/langsmith/platform-setup).
